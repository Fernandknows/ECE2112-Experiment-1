# EXP1 - Introduction to Python Programming <br/> *Christian Justin M. Fernando | 2ECE-B | ECE2112*
Hello! This repository contains Python codes I made for my ECE2112 course, particularly for Experiment #1. <br/><br/> For experiment #1 the problems and instructions are:



**1. Alphabet Soup Problem:** Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order. <br/>

**2. Emoticon Problem:** Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon. <br/>

**3. Unpacking List Problem:** Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then, print all three variables.
